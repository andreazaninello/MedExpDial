            "Clinical case": "A 51-year-old woman comes to the emergency department with a sudden decrease in visual acuity, severe headache, nausea and vomiting. Hypotensive and afebrile. She presented right ophthalmoparesis due to involvement of the third cranial nerve. A cranial CT scan shows a mass in the hyperdense selar region with erosion of the anterior clinoid processes. What is the best approach to follow?",

                "1": "Suspect chemical meningitis derived from a ruptured epidermoid tumor and start immediate treatment with corticosteroids.",
                "2": "It would indicate the performance of a cerebral angiography to rule out an aneurysm, since it is most likely that we are facing a case of subarachnoid hemorrhage and the mass that is evident in the CT is a thrombosed parasellar aneurysm.",

            "Correct answer": "5",
            "Golden explanation": "Pituitary apoplexy is a syndrome characterized by the sudden onset of headache accompanied by ocular motility disturbances and a variable degree of pituitary insufficiency. The cause is usually a rapidly growing pituitary mass secondary to a vascular event (infarction or hemorrhage). General symptoms may range from vomiting or nausea to meningeal irritation. Compression on the chiasm and optic nerve can cause various campimetric deficits (usually greater bitemporal hemianopsia in the superior quadrants) and decreased visual acuity, even blindness. If the mass grows lateral to the sella turcica it can compress the oculomotor nerves, with the common motor ocular nerve being the most frequently affected, because of its more medial course in the cavernous sinus. The test of choice for the diagnosis of pituitary apoplexy is MRI, as CT may not distinguish the region clearly enough to distinguish degenerative or cystic changes from previous bleedings. The finding of erosion of the anterior clinoid processes in the skull CT may support a chronic lesion, which as a result of an acute vascular phenomenon has caused the symptoms. The management of these patients involves strict control of water and electrolyte disturbances and correction of hormonal deficits. In unstable situations as in the case described, with significant visual disturbances, surgical intervention is usually of choice, with transsphenoidal decompression."

Assuming therefore that we are asked which is one of the most frequent complications of the floor of the orbit, two complications should always be highlighted that may indicate surgical treatment, even urgent: diplopia, due to dislocation of the inferior rectus muscle to the underlying maxillary sinus (and even its entrapment); and enophthalmos, which may cause other associated complications in the medium and long term, such as superior palpebral pseudo-ptosis due to loss of orbital volume (option 4 correct). Temporomandibular ankylosis is not considered because, although relatively close to the orbital cavity, it is not part of the orbito-malar complex (option 1 discarded). Involvement of the maxilla can lead to dental malocclusion, but usually occurs in fractures located lower than the orbital cavity (option 2 discarded). Naso-ethmoidal fractures are included in midface fractures, but the bones of the nose are located more anteriorly to the medial orbital rim, and therefore outside the orbit (option 3 discarded)."

There is heterogeneity in the development of Alzheimer's disease symptoms. There are behavioral variants, but in the MIR they usually want you to think of other types of dementias in the face of behavioral symptoms. In fact, the appearance of these symptoms in early stages should alert us and open the range of diagnostic possibilities. Therefore, we discard 2 and 4. Between 1 and 3, I choose 3 for the same reason and because of the emphasis on the decline of functional independence that occurs in these patients."

With this information, she could have several genetic pathologies, but this is the MIR and we are told that the patient does not have an intellectual disability. In the MIR, an adolescent with pubertal delay and short stature should be a Turner until proven otherwise (there were two questions in 2017). Therefore, if that is our first diagnostic suspicion, the HABITUAL test (as the statement says) for diagnosis should be a conventional karyotype (formula: 45, X0). A Turner can also be diagnosed with a FISH (there would only be one signal for the X instead of the two that females usually have) or with an array. However, both array and NGS are usually reserved for patients with non-obvious clinical pictures, intellectual disability, or suspicion of a genetic syndrome that requires these specific tests (for example, an array to diagnose a 22q11 deletion syndrome or an NGS panel to diagnose a Noonan syndrome)."

            "Correct answer": "4",
            "Golden explanation": "The first thing is to treat the infection and for this we must remove all the osteosynthesis material, debride and give antibiotherapy. Fixation in this case is better external to avoid all the material around the affected area, so 4 is correct and 1 and 2 is not. The 3 would be considered after expiration of the infectious picture. TREATMENT - Suppressive antibiotic treatment: indicated in patients with Ciemy type C, it consists of prolonged oral antibiotic therapy for at least 6 months to \"cool\" the exacerbation of the clinical picture. - Curative treatment: includes a first surgery with aggressive tumor-like debridement of all affected tissues, profuse irrigation, stabilization with external fixator if stability is compromised, and eventual filling of the cavities with antibiotic-releasing substances. After prolonged periods of antibiotic therapy selected according to the antibiograms of the cultures, and once it is certain that the infection has been cured, special techniques for the reconstruction of the bone defect and to achieve adequate coverage of soft tissues should be considered. We are dealing with an infection associated with an implant (intramedullary nail) and pseudoarthrosis of the tibia fracture (absence of union after 11 months). The infection is understood by the clinical manifestations (suppuration, nonunion) and the history of diabetes and open fracture. Management overlaps with the management of chronic osteomyelitis. Isolated antibiotherapy (option 2) is indicated only in patients with severe comorbidity in whom surgical treatment would be more aggressive than continuing the disease. Nail dynamization associated with broad-spectrum antibiotherapy (option 1) is not indicated either, because (a) it has not demonstrated benefit in established pseudarthrosis and (b) we have the same issue as option 1, we do not eliminate biofilm. Option 3, discussed, would be considered only if there was no associated infection."

We are not told that he has any contraindication to fibrinolysis, so this would be the most appropriate option due to its rapid administration and action. Sodium heparin is reserved for cases in which the patient is stable. Thromboendarterectomy could be performed urgently in selected centers (not available in all) in patients in whom systemic fibrinolysis is contraindicated, or in centers where the experience with this technique is proven and it can be performed quickly. The inferior vena cava filter is a treatment indicated in the acute phase in stable patients, when anticoagulation is contraindicated; or a posteriori, as prophylaxis, in this group of patients. The indications for fibrinolysis in the last SEPAR consensus document included patients at intermediate risk (they could benefit from it) and high risk. They classify intermediate risk as PESIs \u2265 1 or PESI III-IV. In this subgroup, patients with right ventricular dysfunction, troponin or BNP above the cutoff and deep vein thrombosis appear to benefit most from fibrinolysis.

It presents with a pseudo-flu-like symptomatology (headache, arthralgias, myalgias, fever...) and other symptoms depending on the route of entry. In our case, when attending animal births, the entry is through the respiratory route, so the pulmonary infiltrates and chest pain are due to the bacteria. The treatment varies according to the affectation and mortality is very low, almost null. Morbidity and involvement in pregnant women are of greater concern. Important: it is very frequent in livestock workers (veterinarians, farmers, slaughterhouses...) if you read something like \"attends births of livestock animals\", \"works on a farm\", \"is a veterinarian\" suspect Brucellosis."

The analytical data suggest diabetes insipidus (high plasma osm with low urinary osm). Now we must differentiate between central diabetes insipidus (lack of ADH) or nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (ADH does not exert its action at the renal level). This is achieved by the vasopressin test (intravenous administration of ADH and remeasurement of urinary osmolarity). Therefore, the correct answer is option 3."

She does not give us much information from the ocular examination, only that there is an afferent pupillary defect. We have to rely on systemic symptoms to diagnose the problem. This is an elderly woman with typical symptoms of polymyalgia rheumatica, and the pain in the temporomandibular region is very suggestive. It is giant cell arteritis or temporal arteritis. The most common ocular manifestation is anterior ischemic optic neuropathy. In the fundus we would certainly see a papillary edema of that eye, with a gypsum white coloration. The afferent pupillary defect is very characteristic of these severe ischemic optic neuropathies. Suspecting giant cell arteritis, there are three analytical markers that are characteristically high: CRP, ESR and platelet count. We will first request one of these parameters and treat it often without waiting for biopsy confirmation. Therefore, option 2 is the correct one."

Contrary to what we may think, an unstable thorax due to multiple rib fractures (costal volet) would cause progressive hypoventilation with atelectasis of the pulmonary parenchyma, which would progress on the one hand to hypercapnia and respiratory acidosis, and on the other, to later hypoxemia due to infection associated with atelectasis. Respiratory infection due to aspiration would also occur later, and does not appear in all cases of severe chest trauma, only if there has been a decrease in the level of consciousness (associated TBI, uncontrolled intubation with bronchoaspiration...). Post-traumatic hypovolemia (in this case, as there are multiple rib fractures, it could be due to hemothorax) would occur earlier and would be associated in the first place with hemodynamic instability."

Option 3 of wet form of age-related macular degeneration is also ruled out, because it usually occurs in older patients, although what a patient with myopia magna may present with is myopic macular degeneration (with a similar clinical picture to AMD, but this is a different pathology). A posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) is usually not very symptomatic, producing myodesopsias but no loss of vision or pain; however, some PVDs are of the hemorrhagic type, by traction of the vessels, producing a vitreous hemorrhage that would cause loss of vision. In any case, due to the history of myopia magna and previous intraocular surgery, the first diagnosis to rule out would be retinal detachment, since these are two risk factors for this pathology. Technically, both option 2 and 4 (an acute hemorrhagic DPV) could cause these symptoms, but the most correct option is option 2 (and I am sure it is the one the examiner wants answered)."

We are presented with the case of a three-year-old girl with advanced mammary development, in principle without any associated cause (in principle she does not take drugs that can increase the level of estrogen in the blood, she does not seem to use body creams or eat a lot of chicken meat). If we follow the diagnostic scheme for a premature telarche or suspicion of precocious puberty, we request bone age and abdominal ultrasound (the EO is not advanced as in precocious puberty, and we assume that with a small uterus they mean a prepubertal uterus); according to the complementary examinations that we are given, it does not seem to be precocious puberty, except for the clinical (Tanner IV). Strictly speaking, without analytical hormonal data, it seems that we could mark option 1, being necessary to follow the girl closely. If we take all the above data for granted, we could rule out option 4, which would be the treatment of a central precocious puberty. Regarding the option of mammography, breast ultrasound is used in pediatrics, and in this case it would be indicated if we were told that there is breast asymmetry (we discard option 3).

The idea is to make a differential diagnosis mainly between a cluster headache (whose treatments include answers 2, 3, 4 and 5), a paroxysmal hemicrania (whose treatment of choice is the indomethacin of answer 1) and a SUNCT (unilateral neuralgiform headache with conjunctival injection and lacrimation). Cluster headache predominates in males whose duration can vary between 15-180 minutes, between once every 2 days, up to 8 times a day. Paroxysmal hemicrania predominates in women, with episodes of pain similar to cluster headache, but with a shorter duration (2-30 min), and a higher frequency (5-30 episodes per day). As for SUNCT, the crises are much shorter, lasting seconds (5-240 seconds) and are usually refractory to treatment. Therefore the diagnosis would be of a paroxysmal hemicrania and its treatment of choice is indomethacin (which also the answer is a diagnostic criterion). Therefore correct answer 1 (Indomethacin).

At first glance, we could directly rule out answer 2 since we know that mononucleosis can be an expression of the first phase of HIV infection, especially when we have a history of a risk contact. Answers 3 and 4 are also easily ruled out; ELISA is a very sensitive but not very specific technique and confirmation with a Western-blot test is ALWAYS necessary. Answers 1 and 5 contradict each other if you notice, so one of the two is correct. In this case, the false answer is 1, it is a very categorical answer (\"rule out\") that does not quite fit the reality; As we have said, ELISA is a very sensitive technique, so a negative result could leave us quite calm, however, we all know that there is no medical test that rules out anything with total certainty (unless its sensitivity is 100%, which is not the case) and, on the other hand, we could say that in this case we have a high clinical suspicion (the picture is suggestive, and the antecedents are there). In addition, it is only 3 weeks since the contact, so our patient is probably in the \"window period\" during which serological techniques may be unprofitable. In conclusion, the answer that best fits us would be 5, in the window period a viral load may be indicated for diagnosis (positive if there are more than 10,000 copies), although this test is not done routinely."

Option 3 would be unlikely; in amyloidosis, the light chains that are usually deposited are of the lambda type. Option 4 also seems unlikely, since in IgA myeloma we would expect a monoclonal peak of this Ig, which in this case does not appear. The doubt that arises is between 1 and 5; I would opt for 1, because this entity fulfills the characteristics described (absence of monoclonal peak in most cases, acute renal failure and presence of kappa chains in urine), being light chain myeloma a somewhat broader entity, but option 5 could also be considered valid."

The cause is usually a rapidly growing pituitary mass secondary to a vascular event (infarction or hemorrhage). General symptoms may range from vomiting or nausea to meningeal irritation. Compression on the chiasm and optic nerve can cause various campimetric deficits (usually greater bitemporal hemianopsia in the superior quadrants) and decreased visual acuity, even blindness. If the mass grows lateral to the sella turcica it can compress the oculomotor nerves, with the common motor ocular nerve being the most frequently affected, because of its more medial course in the cavernous sinus. The test of choice for the diagnosis of pituitary apoplexy is MRI, as CT may not distinguish the region clearly enough to distinguish degenerative or cystic changes from previous bleedings. The finding of erosion of the anterior clinoid processes in the skull CT may support a chronic lesion, which as a result of an acute vascular phenomenon has caused the symptoms. The management of these patients involves strict control of water and electrolyte disturbances and correction of hormonal deficits. In unstable situations as in the case described, with significant visual disturbances, surgical intervention is usually of choice, with transsphenoidal decompression."

            "Golden explanation": "A long statement full of rather confusing data. We can attack that question in two ways: by looking at the key data and going all the way to the diagnosis we are considering or by discarding one by one. The choluria, LDH, presence of panagglutinin and the peripheral blood smear \"smells\" like hemolytic anemia. Answer 1 cannot be because a marrow aplasia does not explain the choluria, the elevation of LDH, nor in the study of irregular antibodies is positive in the form of panagglutinin; an aplasia is a marrow failure characterized by a total or partial disappearance of hemopoietic progenitors. In addition, pancytopenia is not observed, which is what would incline us more towards this pathology. Answer 2 is not possible either, since a spherocytosis does not justify the presence of panagglutinin. Answer 3 is the one I consider correct: an autoimmune hemolytic anemia would justify the data given: elevated LDH and bilirubinemia due to red cell destruction, polychromatophilia, spherocytosis and anisocytosis because the marrow is working hard to try to compensate for the anemia, which is regenerative. The study of irregular antibodies and the presence of panagglutinin also supports this response, since the binding of an antibody to the hematocyte promotes its lysis and destruction. The girl presents cough and fever, consistent with a respiratory infection. And the initial treatment is corticosteroids. This is confirmed by Sans Sabrafens in his book \"Clinical Hematology\" [1]. Answer 4 gives rise to considerable doubt; it is not possible because a pernicious anemia does not justify the presence of panagglutinin although it would justify the elevation of LDH and bilirubin; moreover, it is an intramedullary, arregenerative hemolysis, there is no reticulocytosis or release into the blood of immature forms in an attempt to compensate and fix the situation. Answer 5 is not true because no blasts are seen in the blood nor does it explain the presence of panagglutinin."

He presents a diabetic patient on insulin treatment with good control (although diabetic neuropathies do not only develop in patients with poor control) with a sensory picture limited to the upper limbs and of short onset time, without motor symptoms or at any other level. In the examination there is a clear dissociation with thermoalgesic anesthesia and preservation of arthrokinetic and vibratory. Reflexes are normal, neither abolished nor exalted. In addition, the rest of the examination is strictly normal. With all this I believe that the correct answer is 5, that is a syringomyelic lesion, whose initial characteristic is the sensitive dissociation with anesthesia for the thermoalgesic and conservation of the posterior cord. MS and other spinal cord lesions would be accompanied by other exploratory signs such as exaltation of reflexes, for carpal tunnel the exploration exceeds the territory distal to the carpus, and as for answer 1, although there are forms of peripheral polyneuropathy \"pseudosyringomyelic\" they are usually of lumbar onset. The short evolution time (2 weeks), the respect of the lower limbs and the preservation of muscle reflexes make me rule out this response despite the distribution being \"glove-like\"."

All these data, in addition to the analytical data, are describing an immunodeficiency that by the family-maternal history, seems to be X-linked, as several males have died of a similar clinical condition (the father of the patient contributed the Y chromosome, the mother the X). Among the X-linked immunodeficiencies is Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, an entity described with an initial triad of symptoms consisting of bleeding (typical BUT absent in the case: heavy bleeding after circumcision, bloody diarrhea), recurrent infections and eczema. In addition to thrombocytopenia, they are at increased risk for autoimmune phenomena and lymphoid neoplasms. The Hyper-IgE option lacks very characteristic clinical data such as bone alterations and skin lesions, which are not atopic dermatitis, since they follow a different pattern (papulopustular rash on the face and scalp). The option of transient hypogammaglobulinemia of infancy and the common severe and variable combined immunodeficiency fails, among other features, the determination of immunoglobulins G and M, which are at the lower limit, but within normality."

            "Golden explanation": "This question is a bit convoluted for the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome but easy if the steps are clear. We all agree that the patient seems to have Cushing's syndrome (we rule out 1). For the diagnosis we have to measure urinary free cortisol, do a dexamethasone suppression test or measure nocturnal salivary cortisol. If hypercortisolism is confirmed, the origin should be sought; the ACTH measurement indicates the origin: suppressed in hypercortisolism of adrenal origin or prolonged use of corticoids and elevated or normal if the origin is pituitary or by ectopic ACTH secretion. (Therefore, 4 and 5 are false). If ACTH is low, a CT scan of the abdomen should be performed to locate the origin. If ACTH is normal or high, a pituitary MRI should be performed (pituitary adenomas responsible for Cushing's syndrome are very small and CT of the pituitary is less sensitive than MRI). It is very important to perform the order well to arrive at a proper diagnosis: 1st: confirm hypercortisolism or s. Cushing's syndrome, 2nd: measure ACTH to orient etiology. 3rd: imaging test according to ACTH levels. Therefore, answer 2 is false (abdominal CT is not a test to rule out s. Cushing's); an imaging test should only be done once a clear diagnosis of hypercortisolism has been made. Therefore, the true one is 3."

Ultrasound facilitates FNA but is not mandatory, a 2 cm thyroid nodule can be punctured without echo. It is important to have an analysis of thyroid function prior to the puncture; but since he is talking about an asymptomatic patient, it seems clear that she is not hyperthyroid.

We could initially rule out central serous chorioretinopathy because by definition it occurs in young people (up to 55 years of age, more or less). The key to differentiate between the other four is that he had soft drusen in the fundus. That while not a \"diagnosis\" (the question could have been better worded) is a finding related to age-related macular degeneration, or age-related macular degeneration. The dry or atrophic form presents with slowly progressive visual loss. But the wet or exudative form produces acute or rapidly progressive severe visual loss (usually due to subretinal hemorrhage accompanied by metamorphopsia (image distortion due to retinal lifting). An epiretinal membrane usually has a slower course. In a macular hole, visual loss is more relevant (metamorphopsia may also be reported, but it is less likely in the acute stage). In thrombosis of the central retinal vein, visual loss is more important and does not usually explain metamorphopsia (but may have it, due to macular edema)."

Spironolactone, as a potassium-sparing diuretic, inhibits the action of aldosterone at the renal level, being responsible for a decrease in potassium excretion. Hyperkalemia produces repolarization disturbances that result in the installation of a large, symmetrical, narrow-based T, visible in the precordial leads. The QT space is shortened. These anomalies appear with a kalemia of around 5.5 to 6 mmol/l. Above 6.5 mmol/L, electrocardiographic changes are constant, and are dominated by conduction disturbances (making ventricular extrasystoles possible)."

Anyone who does so during residency should be punished with 100 slaps on the back. We discard answer 5. Second: if treatment is given, it should be during the entire pregnancy, prothrombotic status is not only during the puerperium, so answer 2 discarded. Advise a woman not to become pregnant when there are treatments that ensure a very low risk of thrombosis and/or fetal involvement? Answer 1 discarded. We are left with the possibility of not giving any treatment because it is low risk or administering low-dose aspirin. It is true that factor V Leiden in heterozygosis is classified as low risk, who has not presented a previous thrombotic episode nor is there a combination with another thrombophilia; if we look at the CHEST guide, VIII edition and review what was said at the last congress of the Spanish Society of Gynecology and Obstetrics, we see that aspirin is used in case of phospholipid syndrome and that in the case of this woman, without previous thrombosis, without previous abortions (at least two are needed) and also being heterozygous, treatment is not necessary.
