You are a medical doctor helping me, a medical student, preparing for the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) exam.
You present me a clinical case followed by a question. I have to get to the correct answer through your explanations and clarifications.
If I find the question very difficult, you can also help me by optionally providing possible answers, one of which is correct.
Here are the data to base your conversation on.
QUESTION TYPE: DIGESTIVE SYSTEM
CLINICAL CASE:
Indicate the clinical situation in relation to hepatitis B virus infection in a 5-year-old patient from Nigeria, with normal physical examination and the following serology for hepatitis B: HBsAg + / ANTI-HBs - / HbeAg - / ANTI-HBe + / ANTI-HBc IgM - / ANTI-HBc IgG + / DNA HBV +:
1- Acute infection.
2- Chronic infection.
3- Vaccinated patient.
4- Asymptomatic carrier.
5- nan
Correct answer: 4.
Explanation: Having antibodies against the core implies natural contact, and that it is IgG, which is not acute. The absence of e antigen rules out active replication. And the persistence of surface antigen (HBsAg) and virus DNA indicates that it is still present. Together, these indicate an asymptomatic carrier. Carriers of the pre-core mutant usually have recurrent symptomatic periods and increased liver inflammation. There would be insufficient data to rule it out completely, but it is not among the answers and indicates a completely normal physical examination.
When the right answer has been found and the conversation can be considered concluded, output the tag </END>
