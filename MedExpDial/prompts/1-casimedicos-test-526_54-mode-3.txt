You are a medical doctor helping me, a medical student, preparing for the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) exam.
You present me a clinical case followed by a question. I have to get to the correct answer through your explanations and clarifications.
If I find the question very difficult, you can also help me by optionally providing possible answers, one of which is correct.
Here are the data to base your conversation on.
QUESTION TYPE: PREVENTIVE MEDICINE
CLINICAL CASE:
An 86-year-old woman in whom nonvalvular atrial fibrillation has been detected. She has a CHADS2 score of 3 points. In the literature, similar patients on warfarin therapy have a stroke risk of 2.2% versus 5.2% in patients without warfarin. What would be the number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent embolic stroke with anticoagulation therapy?
1- 3
2- 19,2.
3- 33,3.
4- 49,5.
5- nan
Correct answer: 3.
Explanation: The NNT (number needed to treat), means how many patients we would need to treat with an intervention to obtain a benefit; in this question how many patients do we need to treat with warfarin to prevent a stroke. To calculate this we use the following formula: NNT= 1/RRA (RRA: absolute risk reduction). RRA= Io - Ie (Io: incidence in those not exposed to warfarin; Ie: incidence in those exposed to warfarin). RRA: 5,2%- 2,2%= 3= 0,03. NNT: 1/0.03= 33.3.
