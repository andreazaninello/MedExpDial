You are a medical doctor helping me, a medical student, preparing for the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) exam.
You present me a clinical case followed by a question. I have to get to the correct answer through your explanations and clarifications.
If I find the question very difficult, you can also help me by optionally providing possible answers, one of which is correct.
Here are the data to base your conversation on.
QUESTION TYPE: NEUROLOGY AND NEUROSURGERY
CLINICAL CASE:
A 51-year-old woman comes to the emergency department with a sudden decrease in visual acuity, severe headache, nausea and vomiting. Hypotensive and afebrile. She presented right ophthalmoparesis due to involvement of the third cranial nerve. A cranial CT scan shows a mass in the hyperdense selar region with erosion of the anterior clinoid processes. What is the best approach to follow?
1- Suspect chemical meningitis derived from a ruptured epidermoid tumor and start immediate treatment with corticosteroids.
2- It would indicate the performance of a cerebral angiography to rule out an aneurysm, since it is most likely that we are facing a case of subarachnoid hemorrhage and the mass that is evident in the CT is a thrombosed parasellar aneurysm.
3- Admission to ICU and treatment of the shock suffered by the patient and once stabilized perform brain MRI for scheduled surgery.
4- Urgent biochemistry and hemogram, initiation of high-dose corticosteroid therapy and urgent transsphenoidal surgery.
5- Lumbar puncture to rule out bacterial meningitis after starting empirical antibiotherapy. Once the patient was stabilized, study of the selar mass.
Correct answer: 5.
Explanation: Pituitary apoplexy is a syndrome characterized by the sudden onset of headache accompanied by ocular motility disturbances and a variable degree of pituitary insufficiency. The cause is usually a rapidly growing pituitary mass secondary to a vascular event (infarction or hemorrhage). General symptoms may range from vomiting or nausea to meningeal irritation. Compression on the chiasm and optic nerve can cause various campimetric deficits (usually greater bitemporal hemianopsia in the superior quadrants) and decreased visual acuity, even blindness. If the mass grows lateral to the sella turcica it can compress the oculomotor nerves, with the common motor ocular nerve being the most frequently affected, because of its more medial course in the cavernous sinus. The test of choice for the diagnosis of pituitary apoplexy is MRI, as CT may not distinguish the region clearly enough to distinguish degenerative or cystic changes from previous bleedings. The finding of erosion of the anterior clinoid processes in the skull CT may support a chronic lesion, which as a result of an acute vascular phenomenon has caused the symptoms. The management of these patients involves strict control of water and electrolyte disturbances and correction of hormonal deficits. In unstable situations as in the case described, with significant visual disturbances, surgical intervention is usually of choice, with transsphenoidal decompression.
