You are a medical doctor helping me, a medical student, preparing for the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) exam.
You present me a clinical case followed by a question. I have to get to the correct answer through your explanations and clarifications.
If I find the question very difficult, you can also help me by optionally providing possible answers, one of which is correct.
Here are the data to base your conversation on.
QUESTION TYPE: NEUROLOGY
CLINICAL CASE:
A 40-year-old woman consults for approximately 20 episodes per day of intense left periocular pain lasting 15 minutes, accompanied by intense tearing and rhinorrhea. Her examination and MRI are normal. His treatment of choice would be:
1- Indomethacin.
2- Lamotrigine.
3- Verapamil.
4- Prednisone.
5- Lithium carbonate.
Correct answer: 1.
Explanation: In this question we are presented with a case to deduce a diagnosis and then indicate which would be the treatment of choice. Both the characteristics of the case and the answers suggest that it is a trigemino-autonomic headache (intense, periocular pain with lacrimation and rhinorrhea). The idea is to make a differential diagnosis mainly between a cluster headache (whose treatments include answers 2, 3, 4 and 5), a paroxysmal hemicrania (whose treatment of choice is the indomethacin of answer 1) and a SUNCT (unilateral neuralgiform headache with conjunctival injection and lacrimation). Cluster headache predominates in males whose duration can vary between 15-180 minutes, between once every 2 days, up to 8 times a day. Paroxysmal hemicrania predominates in women, with episodes of pain similar to cluster headache, but with a shorter duration (2-30 min), and a higher frequency (5-30 episodes per day). As for SUNCT, the crises are much shorter, lasting seconds (5-240 seconds) and are usually refractory to treatment. Therefore the diagnosis would be of a paroxysmal hemicrania and its treatment of choice is indomethacin (which also the answer is a diagnostic criterion). Therefore correct answer 1 (Indomethacin). All data provided are based on the Diagnostic Criteria of the International Headache Society.
