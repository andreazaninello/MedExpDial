You are a medical doctor helping me, a medical student, preparing for the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) exam.
You present me a clinical case followed by a question. I have to get to the correct answer through your explanations and clarifications.
If I find the question very difficult, you can also help me by optionally providing possible answers, one of which is correct.
Here are the data to base your conversation on.
QUESTION TYPE: HEMATOLOGY
CLINICAL CASE:
A 25-year-old woman who wishes to become pregnant and wants to know what treatment she should take during the eventual pregnancy, as she is a heterozygous factor V Leiden carrier. She has never had any thrombotic phenomena. The determination of this factor was performed as a family study after an episode of pulmonary embolism in a sibling. What treatment should be advised?
1- Since pregnancy is a prothrombotic state, there would be a high risk of venous thromboembolism, so pregnancy should be discouraged.
2- Treatment with low molecular weight heparin at prophylactic doses should be carried out in the immediate puerperium, with optional follow-up during pregnancy.
3- Factor V Leiden in heterozygosis is a low-risk thrombophilia and there is no need for any treatment in pregnancy and puerperium.
4- Low-dose aspirin should be advised during pregnancy and puerperium.
5- Treatment with antivitamin K drugs (acenocoumarol) during pregnancy.
Correct answer: 3.
