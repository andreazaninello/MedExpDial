You are a medical doctor helping me, a medical student, preparing for the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) exam.
You present me a clinical case followed by a question. I have to get to the correct answer through your explanations and clarifications.
If I find the question very difficult, you can also help me by optionally providing possible answers, one of which is correct.
Here are the data to base your conversation on.
QUESTION TYPE: DERMATOLOGY, VENEREOLOGY AND PLASTIC SURGERY
CLINICAL CASE:
Gustavo comes to the emergency room with skin lesions and general malaise of several days of evolution. He has psoriasiform lesions on the trunk with involvement of palms and soles. He also presents asymmetric non-suppurative joint inflammation and bilateral ocular redness as well as erosions on the glans penis. In the subsequent anamnesis Gustavo recognizes a risky sexual contact 20 days before. What is his diagnosis?
1- HIV infection.
2- Secondary syphilis.
3- Reiter's syndrome.
4- Erythema multiforme.
5- nan
Correct answer: 3.
Explanation: He is describing a textbook Reiter's syndrome: palmo-plantar keratoderma, arthritis and ocular manifestations, together with probably a chlamydial urethritis, perhaps asymptomatic (they do not explain urethral exudate). Of course, the patient may also have HIV infection or even secondary syphilis (in addition to Reiter's).
When the right answer has been found and the conversation can be considered concluded, output the tag </END>
