You are a medical doctor helping me, a medical student, preparing for the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) exam.
You present me a clinical case followed by a question. I have to get to the correct answer through your explanations and clarifications.
If I find the question very difficult, you can also help me by optionally providing possible answers, one of which is correct.
Here are the data to base your conversation on.
QUESTION TYPE: RHEUMATOLOGY
CLINICAL CASE:
A 42-year-old female patient reports pain with inflammatory features and swelling in both wrists, 2nd and 3rd metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints bilaterally and left ankle of 4 months of evolution accompanied by morning stiffness of more than one hour duration. Hand X-ray shows an erosion in the styloid process of the ulna in the right carpus. Laboratory tests showed Hb: 10 g/dL with ESR of 45 mm in the first hour, CRP 16 mg/L, rheumatoid factor 160 IU/ML. After 6 months of treatment with indomethacin and methotrexate, the patient persists with pain and swelling of both carpals, morning stiffness lasting 30 minutes and a CBC showing an ESR 30 mm in the first hour and a CRP 9 mg/dL. Regarding the attitude to take, which of the following is true:
1- Suspend the prescribed treatment due to lack of response and initiate prednisone at high doses for symptom control only.
2- Maintain the therapeutic attitude taken since we have only been on it for 6 months and it would be necessary to wait a minimum of 9 months to evaluate therapeutic response.
3- If there is no medical contraindication, consider adding an anti-TNF alpha to the treatment.
4- Start a second disease-modifying drug as soon as possible, since it would not be possible to start treatment with biologic therapy alone after methotrexate.
5- Consider starting treatment with anti-CD20 therapy associated with methotrexate.
Correct answer: 2.
Explanation: This is a patient with rheumatoid arthritis. In my opinion, as in these six months she has shown a clear clinical and biological improvement (decrease in acute phase reactants), I would maintain the therapeutic approach taken and wait for a new evaluation. However, I consider that this question could have another valid answer, 3. It depends a little on the attitude of each rheumatologist. If what you are looking for is a remission of the disease as soon as possible, you could choose to consider associating an anti-TNF alpha?
