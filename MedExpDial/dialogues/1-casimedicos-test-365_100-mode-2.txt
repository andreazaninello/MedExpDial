DOCTOR: Good morning student!
STUDENT: Good morning doctor, let's get started! Can you present the clinical case to me?
DOCTOR: Of course. In this case we have, a 64-year-old patient who used to be a smoker and is currently on corticosteroid therapy for rheumatoid arthritis. He has been presenting a severe headache over the past two days with some deviation of the oral comissura. In his background, he reports a persistent cough following a bout of influenza a month ago, and has recently been having fevers, anorexia, weakness and losing weight. We also have noted a number of skin abscesses on his hands, back and buttocks, some of which have fistulous tracts. He has facial paralysis on the right central side, and his chest X-ray shows apical infiltrates with a small amount of associated pleural effusion. During his initial screening, we also observed an elevated white blood cell count, with a high level of neutrophils. 

What are the primary diseases would you consider in your differential diagnosis based on this information? We can narrow down the options to Lung neoplasm with brain metastases, Disseminated tuberculosis, Nocardiosis, and Aspergillosis.
STUDENT: The key symptoms here are the intense headache, deviation of the oral commissure indicating facial paralysis, skin abscesses, prolonged post-influenza cough that has become productive of purulent and sometimes bloody sputum, fever, anorexia, weakness, and weight loss. The radiological findings of infiltrates with some pleural effusion along with the leukocytosis with neutrophilia also indicate ongoing infection. In the context of the patient's immunosuppression from steroid use and pulmonary changes related to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), these symptoms suggest an infectious etiology, either bacterial or fungal. 

Given the patient's profession of farming, a known risk factor for fungal infections due to exposure to soil and plant matter, I would consider Nocardiosis and Aspergillosis to be strong possibilities. Nocardiosis could present with lung involvement and hematogenous spread to the skin and central nervous system, subsequently causing abscesses, headaches, and neurologic deficits. Aspergillosis would also be plausible given the patient's COPD and immunosuppressed state, and could also lead to invasive disease in the lungs, skin, and CNS.

While lung neoplasm with metastasis and disseminated tuberculosis could be considered, the presence of multiple skin abscesses and the occupation as a farmer are factors that point more towards a widespread fungal infection. However, these differential diagnoses should still be considered and ruled out with appropriate investigations. Thus, I would consider Aspergillosis or Nocardiosis to be the most likely diagnoses in this patient. Should we perform a bronchoscopy with a bronchoalveolar lavage and arrange for serological tests to further confirm these suspicions?
DOCTOR: Fantastic reasoning! You're indeed right that the symptoms suggest an infectious process, most likely caused by bacteria or fungi. Given the patient's medical history of having COPD, being on corticosteroid treatment, and having exposure to farming does suggest a fungal etiology. 

Your line of thought considering Aspergillosis and Nocardiosis is commendable. Both are opportunistic infections and could manifest in the manner presented in the patient. 

I'll make this clear for you: Given the chronicity of symptoms (which suggests a slow onset, not acute onset) and a clinical picture of immunosuppression, along with pulmonary and extra-pulmonary (disseminated) manifestations such as cutaneous abscesses, lung infiltrates and facial nerve involvement, the diagnosis leans more towards Nocardiosis.

Nocardia, an aerobic actinobacteria ubiquitous in soil and water, has a predilection for patients with weakened immune systems, such as those with rheumatologic diseases on long-term corticosteroid therapy. It frequently causes lung disease, which can cavitate and may lead to empyema, but can also spread hematogenously to virtually any other site in the body, including the brain and skin, causing abscesses. 

So, our most likely diagnosis should be Nocardiosis. 

However, as you correctly pointed that diagnostics should include material for culture (sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage or blood), stain (Gram, modified acid-fast), and imaging (chest CT, brain if neurological symptoms or findings), which may guide more definite treatment. 

Great job with the reasoning, keep up the good work! </END>
STUDENT: Thank you, doctor, for your detailed explanation and confirming the most likely diagnosis as Nocardiosis. The tie-ins between the patient's history, occupation, and current immunosuppressed state with the presentation of his symptoms helped me draw this conclusion. I learn a lot with these walk-through case studies and I'm eager to delve into more challenging cases in the future. Looking forward to our next session.</END>
