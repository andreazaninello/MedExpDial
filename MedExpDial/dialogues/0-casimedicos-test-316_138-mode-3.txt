DOCTOR: Good morning student!
STUDENT: Good morning doctor, let's get started! Can you present the clinical case to me?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, let's dive in.

We have a 37-year-old man who came to the clinic due to arthritis of the metacarpophalangeal joints in both hands and right pleuritis. On physical examination, we noted bilateral malar erythema. The patient's lab report showed positive antinuclear antibodies (with a titer of 1/640), positive anti-native DNA antibodies, and negative anti-Sm.

Now based on this patient's presentation and results, what do you think would be the initial treatment of choice for this patient? Would you like me to present few options?
STUDENT: This patient's symptoms, particularly the malar erythema (also known as a butterfly rash), arthritis, and pleuritis combined with the laboratory results of positive antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and positive anti-native DNA antibodies, are suggestive of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). 

The primary goal in SLE treatment is reducing the patient's symptoms, preventing flare-ups, and minimizing long-term complications. The exact course of treatment often varies based on the patient's symptoms and the severity of the disease. 

For this patient who is presenting with pleuritis and arthritis, a conventional first-line treatment would be to prescribe nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to manage the arthritis pain. 

However, NSAIDs alone may not be sufficient given the moderate to severe disease signs. This patient would likely get more significant relief from symptoms and disease control through the use of anti-malarials like hydroxychloroquine. It reduces disease activity in patients with SLE and is typically well-tolerated with lower risk of severe side effects. 

So in this case, the initial treatment of choice for this patient would likely be hydroxychloroquine. But I would like to hear the options you have in mind to be certain.
DOCTOR: Sure! I have drafted the following treatment options:

1. Glucocorticoids at high doses.
2. Glucocorticoids and mycophenolate.
3. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and antimalarials.
4. The picture will probably be self-limited and does not require treatment.

Based on these choices, do you still stand with your initial conclusion or would you reconsider?
STUDENT: Given these options, I would reconsider my initial conclusion. Considering the patient's symptoms are severe with the presence of pleuritis - a serositis indicating significant inflammatory disease activity, the treatment should be more aggressive at first.

High-dose glucocorticoids (option 1) would be the initial treatment of choice in this case. Glucocorticoids like prednisone would be used to rapidly control inflammation, especially in severe SLE with organ-threatening or life-threatening manifestations like serositis.

Afterward, once the initial inflammation is controlled, immunosuppressive agents could be considered for maintenance, and antimalarials including hydroxychloroquine for long-term management to prevent flare-ups. 

Therefore, based on these options and the severity of the patient's presentation, I would now choose option 1 - glucocorticoids at high doses - as the initial treatment of choice.
DOCTOR: Excellent! Your revised choice is correct. Indeed, this patient has SLE with manifesting symptoms of joint pain, skin rashes and pleuritis, which is inflammation of the tissues surrounding the lungs. This indicates severe disease activity. Hence, high-dose glucocorticoids (option 1) is indeed the best initial treatment approach. 

In this acute phase, glucocorticoids are used because of their potent anti-inflammatory effects. The treatment plan may later involve step-down or maintenance therapies including antimalarials or immunosuppressive agents such as mycophenolate, but only after the disease is under control.

Good job on the critical thinking and reassessing your options according to the patient's specific clinical features. You are doing excellent work! </END>
STUDENT: Thank you, doctor, for the feedback and clarification. It's an essential learning point to understand that treatment strategies and decisions often have to be revised as more information becomes available, especially in complex diseases like SLE. I appreciate your guidance. I am ready for the next case. </END>
