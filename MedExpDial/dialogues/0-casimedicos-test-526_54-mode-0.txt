DOCTOR: Good morning student!
STUDENT: Good morning doctor, let's get started! Can you present the clinical case to me?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We have an 86-year-old woman who has been diagnosed with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. Her CHADS2 score, which is a clinical prediction rule for predicting stroke risk in patients with non-rheumatic atrial fibrillation, is 3 points. 

Now, according to some medical literature, similar patients who are on warfarin therapy have a stroke risk of 2.2%. On the other hand, those patients not on warfarin have a higher stroke risk of 5.2%. 

Based on these data, the question here is: what would be the number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent embolic stroke with anticoagulation therapy?
STUDENT: Let's put the data together:
Patients on warfarin have a stroke risk of 2.2%, and those not on warfarin have a stroke risk of 5.2%. 

Number needed to treat (NNT) is calculated by the formula: 

     NNT = 1 / (Risk untreated - Risk treated)

Let's substitute the values:

    NNT = 1 / (5.2% - 2.2%) 

Calculating this will give us the NNT. Could you proceed with the calculation, doctor?
DOCTOR: Sure, let's continue with the calculation. 
First, we'll need to convert the percentages to decimals:

5.2% becomes 0.052 and 2.2% becomes 0.022. 

Then we will substitute these numbers into the NNT formula:

    NNT = 1 / (0.052 - 0.022) 
    NNT = 1 / 0.030

If we calculate that, we find that the NNT is approximately 33.33. 

Since we cannot treat a fraction of a person, we would generally round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, in this scenario, the NNT to prevent one embolic stroke with anticoagulation therapy would be 34. 

This means that we would have to treat 34 similar patients with anticoagulation therapy to prevent one stroke. Does that make sense?
STUDENT: Yes, doctor, it makes sense. The number needed to treat (NNT) represents the average number of patients who need to be treated to prevent one additional bad outcome, in this case, an embolic stroke. So in this scenario, treating 34 similar patients with anticoagulation therapy would, on average, prevent one stroke, which underscores the importance of the therapy for this patient's condition. Thank you for the clear explanation!
DOCTOR: You're welcome and great job! Your understanding of the concept and how to apply it is correct. I like your point underscoring the clinical significance of the NNT in this case. 

Remember, the logic behind the NNT is indeed that, in preventive medicine and in many treatments, not all patients subjected to the intervention will necessarily benefit from it, even if the intervention is generally effective. 

Good luck with your studies and your preparation for the USMLE! Keep up the good work. </END>
STUDENT: Thank you for your guidance and encouragement, doctor! I appreciate the opportunity to learn from your expertise. I'll continue my studies and preparation for the USMLE exam. Have a great day! </END>
