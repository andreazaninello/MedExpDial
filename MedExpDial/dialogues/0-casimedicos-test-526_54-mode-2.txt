DOCTOR: Good morning student!
STUDENT: Good morning doctor, let's get started! Can you present the clinical case to me?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Here is a clinical case:

An 86-year-old woman has been diagnosed with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. This patient has a CHADS2 score of 3 points. Research has shown that patients like her who are treated with warfarin therapy have a stroke risk of 2.2% compared to 5.2% in patients that do not receive warfarin. The question for you is: What would be the number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one embolic stroke with anticoagulation therapy?

Let's start with understanding the term. The "Number Needed to Treat," or NNT, is a measurement that indicates how many people need to be treated for one person to benefit. It's determined using the formula: 1/(Absolute Risk Reduction).

What do you think, based on the given data?
STUDENT: To calculate the Number Needed to Treat (NNT), we need to determine the absolute risk reduction (ARR), which is calculated by the untreated risk minus the treated risk. 

In this case, the untreated risk (patients not on warfarin) is 5.2%, and the treated risk (patients on warfarin) is 2.2%. 

We need to convert these percentages to decimals (divide by 100), so we have 0.052 and 0.022 respectively. 

Now, calculate the ARR: 

    ARR = 0.052 - 0.022 = 0.030

Now we can use the formula for the NNT = 1/ARR, which in this case will be:

    NNT = 1 / 0.030 

Does that explanation make sense and are you ready to perform this calculation?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, you are on the right track. Now, when you calculate 1 divided by 0.030, what result do you get?
STUDENT: The calculation would be:

NNT = 1 / 0.030 = 33.33

So, approximately 33 patients would need to be treated with warfarin to prevent one embolic stroke. Since we can't treat a third of a patient, we usually round this up to the nearest whole number. So in this scenario, we'd say the NNT is approximately 34. Is that a correct understanding, doctor?
DOCTOR: Almost there, your understanding of the concept and calculation are spot on! However, the general convention in the medical field is to round down, rather than round up in this context. So in our case, the NNT would actually be deemed 33, not 34. So the closest numerical answer from the provided options that matches with this is 33,3. Therefore, the answer would be number 3 from those given. Remember, the smaller the NNT, the more effective the intervention is!
STUDENT: Thank you for the clarification, doctor. That makes sense. So, in this case, we would need to treat approximately 33 patients with the anticoagulation therapy to prevent one stroke. I understand now that the NNT allows us to estimate the effectiveness of a treatment, and the smaller the number, the more effective the intervention. This is a valuable insight to consider when making clinical decisions. I appreciate your guidance!
DOCTOR: Great understanding! Yes, you've got it. The NNT indeed is a helpful tool to gauge the effectiveness of an intervention and balance it against possible risks. This contributes to an important aspect of evidence-based medicine. I'm glad to see your progress. Keep going and do not hesitate to ask if there are any more queries. That concludes this case study! 

</END>
STUDENT: Thank you, doctor, for this case study and your valuable insights. I have a clearer understanding of the concept and calculation of NNT now and its importance in clinical decisions and evidence-based medicine. I'm sure this will be very beneficial in my studies and future career. I look forward to more learning opportunities with you. </END>
