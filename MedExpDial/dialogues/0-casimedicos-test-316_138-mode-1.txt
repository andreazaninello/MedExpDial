DOCTOR: Good morning student!
STUDENT: Good morning doctor, let's get started! Can you present the clinical case to me?
DOCTOR: Of course. Here is the case:

Our patient is a 37-year-old man. He came complaining of joint pain specifically, in the metacarpophalangeal joints of both his hands and also has signs of right pleuritis. Upon examination, I noticed bilateral malar erythema. Lab tests were done, where positive antinuclear antibodies (ANA) were detected at a titer of 1/640, and anti-native DNA antibodies also tested positive. However, he tested negative for anti-Smith (anti-Sm) antibodies.

Given these symptoms and results, I want to know: what would be the initial treatment of choice for this patient?
STUDENT: This patient's presentation is suggestive of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The characteristic malar rash, arthritis, and serositis (pleuritis) are fulfilling 3 out of 11 criteria for SLE diagnosis. 

The presence of positive antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and anti-native (double-stranded) DNA antibodies further support this diagnosis. Anti-Sm antibodies can be seen in SLE, but their absence does not rule out the disease.

Considering the patient's symptoms are not severe and there is no evidence of major organ involvement (like kidney or central nervous system), the initial treatment would probably be conservative in nature. NSAIDs would be recommended for symptomatic relief of arthritis and serositis. 

However, antimalarials such as hydroxychloroquine are generally recommended as first-line therapy in all patients with SLE regardless of disease severity due to benefits including lessening future disease activity and reducing mortality. Hydroxychloroquine help in alleviating the rash, arthritis, and pleuritis this patient is experiencing and would also serve as a prophylaxis against flares. 

So, to answer the question, the initial treatment of choice for this patient should be Hydroxychloroquine.
DOCTOR: Actually, while your reasoning is correct in many instances, in this particular case it's not fully accurate. You are correct in diagnosing the patient with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, and Hydroxychloroquine is a common treatment used for long-term management of SLE patients, especially to prevent disease flares.

However, the presence of severe and active features such as right pleuritis and high anti-DNA levels in this patient suggest a severe disease flare. Severe flares, particularly if they feature major organ involvement or high disease activity, require more aggressive treatment. 

So, think again, considering those symptoms, what could be the initial treatment of choice for a severe flare-up of SLE?
STUDENT: I see, thank you for the clarification. As this is a severe flare-up of SLE with organ involvement, we would be looking at more aggressive treatment options.

In such cases, corticosteroids are often the first choice of treatment. High-dose corticosteroids, such as prednisone, would be used initially to bring inflammation under control quickly. 

After inflammation is controlled and symptoms have improved, the dosage would be gradually reduced to the lowest effective dose in order to minimize side effects of long-term high-dose use.

In some situations, immunosuppressive drugs such as cyclophosphamide or azathioprine may be used if the patient does not respond to corticosteroid treatment, or if there is severe kidney involvement.

So, considering the severe flare-up and organ involvement in this case, the initial treatment of choice would likely be high-dose corticosteroids, such as prednisone.
DOCTOR: Exactly, well done! In severe flare-ups of SLE, high-dose glucocorticoids are the initial treatment of choice. The inflammation presented in SLE is due to the body's immune system attacking its own tissues, so the immunosuppressive properties of glucocorticoids help reduce this inflammation quickly. Once the inflammation is under control, we can then step down the dosage and add long-term management medications such as hydroxychloroquine or immunosuppressants, as you previously mentioned. Great job figuring it out! </END>
STUDENT: Thank you, doctor, for the great explanation and feedback. This was a rather challenging case that certainly helped deepen my understanding of SLE and the approach to its management, especially during severe flare-ups. I appreciate your guidance and look forward to more challenging cases in the future. </END>
