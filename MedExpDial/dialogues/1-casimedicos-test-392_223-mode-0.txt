DOCTOR: Good morning student!
STUDENT: Good morning doctor, let's get started! Can you present the clinical case to me?
DOCTOR: Absolutely! We have a 68-year-old female patient who historically has had 2 major depressive episodes. Recently, she reported experiencing symptoms of sadness, depressed mood, anhedonia, asthenia, and anorexia. These symptoms suggest another depressive episode. After being prescribed 10 mg of escitalopram, the patient experienced a significant mood shift. Just two weeks later, she is rising early, demonstrating hyperactivity, and showing an intense desire to remain active. She reports feeling increased energy levels and has become more talkative than usual. Despite this increased activity, she does not seem irritable and is able to sleep consistently for 6 hours. Based on these new developments, how would you diagnose this patient?
STUDENT: It seems that the patient's symptoms align with a hypomanic episode. Hypomania is characterized by at least four days of inflated self-esteem or grandiosity, decreased need for sleep, increased talkativeness, racing thoughts or ideas, distractibility, increased goal-directed activity or psychomotor agitation, and excessive involvement in risky behaviors. However, hypomanic episodes are not severe enough to cause notable social or occupational dysfunction or to necessitate hospitalization, and there are no psychotic features. The speed of her switch from a depressive episode to a hypomanic episode might suggest the patient is suffering from Bipolar II Disorder. In such a case cyclic antidepressants, unopposed by a mood stabilizer, might induce a rapid cycling course or provoke a switch into hypomania, mania, or mixed states. Can you confirm my diagnosis, doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, your appraisal is correct! This patient is demonstrating symptoms that are indicative of a Hypomanic Episode. It's important to note that hypomania, while less extreme than mania, still represents a significant change from a person's usual behavior. This sudden shift from a depressive state to hypomania post administration of escitalopram in our patient can indeed suggest Bipolar II Disorder. Antidepressant monotherapy has been known to induce these swings in mood, thus careful monitoring of patients can help in diagnosing Bipolar Disorders which might have been previously unrecognized. Good work on diagnosing this complex case! </END>
STUDENT: Thank you, doctor. It's crucial to be vigilant about these subtle changes when treating patients with depressive episodes, as it can lay the groundwork for diagnosing previously overlooked Bipolar Disorders. I appreciate your guidance.
