DOCTOR: Good morning student!
STUDENT: Good morning doctor, let's get started! Can you present the clinical case to me?
DOCTOR: Absolutely! Here's the case:

We have a 37-year-old man who presented with arthritis affecting the metacarpophalangeal joints of both his hands and right pleuritis. Upon examination, bilateral malar erythema was observed. Laboratory findings revealed positive antinuclear antibodies (titer 1/640), along with positive anti-native DNA antibodies; however, the anti-Sm was found to be negative. 

Now, based on the information you've been given, what would you suggest as the initial treatment of choice for this patient?
STUDENT: This patient's clinical presentation combined with his lab findings are suggestive of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). Symptoms such as malar rash, arthritis and pleuritis along with positive antinuclear and anti-native DNA antibodies are consistent with this diagnosis.

The severity of SLE could range from mild to severe, and this would determine his treatment of choice. Mild cases are often managed with NSAIDs and antimalarial drugs such as hydroxychloroquine. However, in moderate to severe disease like in this patient with significant musculoskeletal and pleural involvement, corticosteroid therapy and immunosuppressive drugs play a critical role.

The initial treatment of choice for this patient would therefore be high dose corticosteroids, often alongside immunosuppressants like cyclophosphamide or mycophenolate mofetil, to control inflammation and prevent further organ damage. Hydroxychloroquine could also be used in maintenance therapy. 

This treatment needs to be tailored to the patient's needs and balanced against possible side effects. Close monitoring would be necessary to assess for any disease progression and manage timely changes to his therapy. I'd love to hear if you agree with this approach, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Excellent analysis! Each aspect you have clearly explained is correct. Yes, this patientâ€™s clinical presentation and laboratory findings indeed suggest systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). 

Furthermore, besides the potential severity of this patient's symptoms, as you have noted, we must also consider potential side effects and closely monitor him, adjusting his therapy as necessary.

Your initial plan of high doses of corticosteroids is exactly the right answer. There is also the potential later on for other treatments, like immunosuppressants or hydroxychloroquine, to be utilized in the maintenance phase of managing this disease. However, the first line of defense against this acute flare of SLE would be corticosteroids.

Great job! Keep up your excellent work! </END>
STUDENT: Thank you so much for your feedback and guidance, Doctor! I'll keep studying and applying what I learn in these case discussions. I appreciate this opportunity to learn and grow.
