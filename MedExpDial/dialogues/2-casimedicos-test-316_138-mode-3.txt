DOCTOR: Good morning student!
STUDENT: Good morning doctor, let's get started! Can you present the clinical case to me?
DOCTOR: Sure, here we go:
A 37-year-old man presents with arthritis of the metacarpophalangeal joints of both hands and right pleuritis. Upon examination, bilateral malar erythema is noted. Lab results come back positive for antinuclear antibodies with a titer of 1/640. Anti-native DNA antibodies are also positive; however, anti-Sm antibodies are negative. 

What would be the best initial treatment of choice for this patient?
STUDENT: This patient's presentation, including symptoms of arthritis, right pleuritis, malar rash, and positive results for antinuclear antibodies and anti-native DNA antibodies, is strongly suggestive of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE).

In terms of treatment, for mild disease, Hydroxychloroquine is often the first-line treatment, and NSAIDs can be used to manage symptoms like arthritis. However, given the systemic nature of this patient's disease (manifested by pleuritis), more aggressive initial treatment is likely warranted.

Therefore, high-dose glucocorticoids like prednisone would typically be the initial treatment of choice, as it has potent anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties to manage the severe inflammation caused by SLE. If the disease is refractory to corticosteroids or if the patient is steroid-dependent, immunosuppressants such as azathioprine, methotrexate, or mycophenolate can be used.

In summary, I'd suggest starting with high-dose glucocorticoids. Is that correct?
DOCTOR: Yes, you are absolutely correct! Patients with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) presenting with joint, skin, and serositis involvement, as in this clinical case, would typically require treatment with moderate to high doses of glucocorticoids initially, to control the disease's systemic inflammation promptly and prevent further organ damage.

Mycophenolate is typically not used in the acute phase but may be included in the maintenance treatment. However, it has not proven useful specifically in joint involvement in SLE. 

So, option 1, 'Glucocorticoids at high doses', would indeed be the best initial treatment choice for this patient.

You have explained everything very thoroughly and correctly. Well done! </END>
STUDENT: Thank you for the feedback, doctor! I appreciate your clarification on the use of mycophenolate in managing SLE. I am ready to proceed with the next case when you are.
