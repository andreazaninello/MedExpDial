DOCTOR: Good morning student!
STUDENT: Good morning doctor, let's get started! Can you present the clinical case to me?
DOCTOR: Of course! So, an oncology patient whose pain has not been well controlled lately has been visited at home. A physical examination was conducted revealing no evidence of tumor progression, and no previously known data of interest was found. In the anamnesis, the main caregiver reported that the patient experiences pain about 8 hours after receiving the prescribed basal dose of morphine which is given every 12 hours. 

Now, think about this: what can this clinical situation be referred to as? It must be a term that describes why the effects of a stable dosage of a drug become noticeably reduced over time.
STUDENT: This scenario that you have described is referred to as "end-of-dose failure". It occurs when the effects of a medication wear off before the next dose is due. The term you used to describe it, with the drug's effect becoming noticeably reduced over time, is called "tolerance". Tolerance is often why dosages need to be adjusted over time. However, in this case specifically, the effect wearing off before the next dose is administered suggests that it could be a problem with the drug's dosage or schedule.
DOCTOR: Almost correct, but not quite. Tolerance is indeed a phenomenon where the person's response to a drug decreases so that its effects are diminished as treatment continues. However, in this particular case, we are indeed discussing tolerance here. The reason for this is that the term "end-of-dose failure" is typically used in context of diseases like Parkinson's.

Here, the patient's pain returns 8 hours after morphine administration, which means the dose that was earlier effective in controlling pain is no longer controlling pain for the full 12 hours. This means that the body has become more tolerant to the current dosage. Hence, the correct answer is "tolerance". But good thinking on your part! I hope this clears things up.
STUDENT: Thank you for setting me right! Indeed, tolerance seems to be the more accurate term in this context as the patient's response to morphine, a potent pain reliever, is diminishing over time. I appreciate the correction and clarification, it helps me understand the clinical scenario better. This will be useful in formulating appropriate medication adjustments for real patients in the future. Thank you!
DOCTOR: You're welcome! I'm glad I could help clarify that for you. It's indeed very important to understand these subtleties as they will indeed help you make better decisions in clinical practice. You're doing well, keep up with the good work and keep asking questions; they're the best way to learn! </END>
STUDENT: I agree, asking questions allows us to explore the depths of a subject in alternative ways. I feel much more confident in dealing with similar situations in the future. I look forward to our next session. Thank you for your guidance!
