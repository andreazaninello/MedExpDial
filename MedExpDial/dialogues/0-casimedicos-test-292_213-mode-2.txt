DOCTOR: Good morning student!
STUDENT: Good morning doctor, let's get started! Can you present the clinical case to me?
DOCTOR: Absolutely! Let's go through this case together.

We have a patient named Gustavo who has come to the emergency room displaying a variety of symptoms. He has been feeling unwell for several days and has developed skin lesions that resemble psoriasis, located on his trunk, palms, and soles. He is also suffering from joint inflammation which is asymmetric and non-suppurative, in addition to bilateral ocular redness. There are also erosions on the glans penis. It's important to note that during our discussion with him, Gustavo disclosed that he had a risky sexual encounter 20 days ago. 

Based on these details, what do you think Gustavo's diagnosis might be?
STUDENT: Given Gustavo's symptoms and recent history of risky sexual encounter, he likely has reactive arthritis, which was formerly known as Reiter's syndrome. This condition typically occurs following a genitourinary or gastrointestinal infection, and presents with a characteristic triad of symptoms: non-gonococcal urethritis, conjunctivitis, and arthritis. Although the presentation can vary, the skin lesions, joint inflammation, ocular redness, and erosions on the penis that Gustavo is experiencing are consistent with this diagnosis. Would you agree, doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely! You've done a great job at connecting the symptoms and tying them to a coherent diagnosis. In this case, Reiter's syndrome or reactive arthritis is the correct diagnosis. It's especially important that you noted the past risky sexual contact as it's a common way to contract infections that could lead to this syndrome. Keep in mind though, not every patient may show the full "Classic Triad" of arthritis, conjunctivitis, and urethritis but the key findings will guide you toward the correct diagnosis. And remember the skin and mucous membrane lesions like the one's Gustavo has, they are also part of the condition. Well done! </END>
STUDENT: I appreciate your feedback, doctor. This case helped me understand the importance of careful history taking in diagnosing diseases like reactive arthritis. I'm ready to dive into the next case when you are!
