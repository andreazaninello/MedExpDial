DOCTOR: Good morning student!
STUDENT: Good morning doctor, let's get started! Can you present the clinical case to me?
DOCTOR: Of course! So, you're working in primary care and you were called to visit a patient at home - someone who's under oncology care. This patient has recently been struggling with inadequate pain control. When you perform a physical examination, there's no sign of tumor progression and no other significant historical data comes to light.

The patient's primary caregiver tells you that the patient typically starts feeling pain around 8 hours after receiving their prescribed twice-daily dose of morphine. Can you identify what this situation is referred to as?
STUDENT: The situation described here, where the patient experiences pain before the next dose of medication, is referred to as breakthrough pain. However, this seems somewhat regular, so a more specific term might be that the patient is experiencing end-of-dose failure or end-of-dose pain. This typically indicates that the current dosing schedule or dosage may not be adequate for this patient's pain management.
DOCTOR: Bravo! You're right. This is indeed called end-of-dose failure or end-of-dose pain. It refers to a situation where the effect of a pain medication wears off before it is due for the next dose. This suggests that the patient's pain management regime needs adjustment, either in the form of shortening the dosing interval or increasing the dosage. Keep on practicing, you're doing really well! </END>
STUDENT: Thank you, doctor! This was indeed an interesting case to consider, as handling pain management is a critical aspect of patient care, especially in dealing with oncology patients. I will keep this in mind for my future practice and of course, the upcoming USMLE. I look forward to discussing further cases with you.
