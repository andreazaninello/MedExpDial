DOCTOR: Good morning student!
STUDENT: Good morning doctor, let's get started! Can you present the clinical case to me?
DOCTOR: Of course! We have a 70-year-old woman here. She has a history of anorexia, weight loss, discomfort in her muscles and proximal joints, plus she's experiencing pain in her temporomandibular region. Recently, she made a visit to the emergency department for unilateral loss of vision that was sudden, painless, and accompanied by an afferent pupillary defect. The question here is - what would be the first diagnostic test that you would request?
STUDENT: This patient's presentation is suggestive of Temporal (Giant Cell) Arteritis, a disease of older adults that presents with headache (frequently in the temporal region), jaw claudication, systemic symptoms like weight loss and anorexia, and, in severe cases, vision changes due to involvement of the ophthalmic artery.

The recommended first diagnostic test would be the Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR). Giant cell arteritis is a systemic inflammation condition which typically results in a significantly elevated ESR. If the ESR is elevated, a temporal artery biopsy should be done to confirm the diagnosis. Prompt diagnosis and treatment with corticosteroids is essential in order to prevent irreversible blindness.
DOCTOR: You're right to suspect Temporal (Giant Cell) Arteritis in this patient, given her age, symptoms, and sudden unilateral vision loss. The systemic symptoms and involvement of the temporomandibular region along with an afferent pupillary defect compels us towards this diagnosis. However, recent guidelines also suggest the use of a test which is more sensitive than ESR for systemic inflammation. What could that be?
STUDENT: The other test that is more sensitive than ESR and frequently used when suspecting systemic inflammation is the C-reactive protein (CRP) test. Like the ESR, CRP is a part of the acute phase reactants and goes up when there is systemic inflammation in the body. So, if the ESR is elevated and the clinical suspicion is high, we should further evaluate the patient with a CRP test. The definitive diagnosis of Temporal Arteritis still requires a biopsy of the temporal artery.
DOCTOR: That's correct, well done! CRP is indeed a very sensitive marker for inflammation and it's the answer we're looking for in this case. This patient's test of choice should be C-reactive protein due to its high sensitivity, alongside its correlation with disease activity in Temporal Arteritis. Remember though, it guides our clinical suspicion but does not confirm the diagnosis. Temporal artery biopsy remains the gold standard for definitive diagnosis. Keep up the good work! </END>
STUDENT: Thank you, doctor! I appreciate your feedback and guidance. I'll keep that in mind for future cases. Looking forward to learning more!
