DOCTOR: Good morning student!
STUDENT: Good morning doctor, let's get started! Can you present the clinical case to me?
DOCTOR: Sure! We will be looking at the case of a 70-year-old woman. She has a history of anorexia, weight loss, discomfort in her muscles and proximal joints, as well as pain in her temporomandibular region. Recently, she came to the emergency department due to a sudden, painless, unilateral loss of vision, only being able to perceive hand movements. She also displays an afferent pupillary defect. Now, what test would you first request in order to diagnose what's happening with our patient?
STUDENT: The sudden, painless loss of vision and afferent pupillary defect suggest possible damage to the retina or optic nerve. The systemic features such as weight loss and anorexia, and her age suggest a possible vasculitis, specifically Giant Cell Arteritis (Temporal Arteritis). 

The first-line diagnostic test for suspected Temporal Arteritis would be an Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) to assess for systemic inflammation. If the ESR and CRP are elevated, a temporal artery biopsy would be the definitive diagnostic test, although it might not be the first test to request. So, for this patient, I would initially request an ESR and CRP.
DOCTOR: Excellent response and reasoning! You correctly recognized the potential for Giant Cell Arteritis (Temporal Arteritis) given this patient's age, systemic symptoms, discomfort in the temporomandibular region, and the particularly concerning symptom of sudden, unilateral loss of vision. The afferent pupillary defect, in this case, is also a significant clue, indicating significant optic nerve dysfunction. Given all of these clues, inflammatory markers such as Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) and C-Reactive Protein (CRP) would indeed be the first diagnostic test to request. So, the correct answer would be "2- C-reactive protein." 

Great work! I can see your understanding of these concepts is solid. Keep up the good work. </END>
STUDENT: Thank you, Doctor! This case was a great example of how important it is to connect all the dots when dealing with a complex diagnosis. I am ready for the next case!
