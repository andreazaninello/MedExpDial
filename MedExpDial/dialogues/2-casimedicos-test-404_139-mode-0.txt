DOCTOR: Good morning student!
STUDENT: Good morning doctor, let's get started! Can you present the clinical case to me?
DOCTOR: Sure, let's do it. We have a 70-year-old woman who has a history of anorexia, weight loss, discomfort in her muscles and proximal joints. She also has pain in her temporomandibular region. She came to the emergency department with sudden and painless unilateral loss of vision, to the extent where she can only perceive hand movement. There's also an associated afferent pupillary defect. 

So the question for you is: What test would you request first for diagnostic purposes?
STUDENT: Given the patient's symptoms of anorexia, weight loss, muscle and joint discomfort, temporomandibular region pain, plus sudden unilateral loss of vision and an afferent pupillary defect, one should be suspicious of Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA) or Temporal Arteritis. The test of choice to diagnose this disease is a Temporal Artery Biopsy. However, due to the urgency to prevent further vision loss, treatment should be started even before the biopsy results come back if the clinical suspicion is high. The patient should be started on high-dose corticosteroids immediately. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) are also usually elevated in GCA and can be markers of response to treatment. So, although Temporal Artery Biopsy is the definitive test, I would first order an ESR and CRP blood test immediately.
DOCTOR: Excellent response and great job analyzing the patient's symptoms and clinical picture! Your reasoning is correct. Given the symptoms presented, a high suspicion for Giant Cell Arteritis is appropriate. 

Therefore, getting an Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) and C-Reactive Protein (CRP) would indeed be the first diagnostic tests to order. They are non-specific but are typically elevated in GCA, can be ordered and returned quickly, and can help guide initiation of therapy. As you rightly pointed out, further definitive diagnosis with Temporal Artery Biopsy should be sought, but management with high-dose corticosteroids should begin promptly if GCA is suspected so as to prevent further potential vision loss. 

Well done! </END>
STUDENT: Thank you, doctor. I've learned a lot from this case. The importance of immediate necessary action in emergent cases like this is duly noted. Preventing further vision loss in GCA is crucial, and treatment should not be delayed even if awaiting a biopsy. I will remember to consider GCA in elderly patients presenting with symptoms like anorexia, weight loss, muscle discomfort, and sudden vision loss. I am ready for the next case.
