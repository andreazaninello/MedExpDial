DOCTOR: Good morning student!
STUDENT: Good morning doctor, let's get started! Can you present the clinical case to me?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We have a 40-year-old woman who has been experiencing quite frequent episodes - approximately 20 times per day - of intense left-sided periocular, or around the eye, pain. Each of these episodes last around 15 minutes. These episodes of pain also come with intense tearing and rhinorrhea, or a runny nose. Her physical examination and MRI scans have all come back normal. Can you tell me what your initial thoughts are about this case?
STUDENT: This patient's symptoms fit well with a diagnosis known as cluster headaches. They are typically known for their incredibly painful and frequent nature, as well as for being sided, usually occurring around or behind one eye. They can occur many times a day, and are usually brief, which matches this patient's symptom duration. Symptoms often include other signs of autonomic dysregulation like tearing or a runny nose, which is also present.
DOCTOR: You're absolutely right! Given the patient's presenting symptoms, a diagnosis of cluster headaches is highly likely. These attacks, characterized by severe uniocular pain, conjunctival injection, lacrimation, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, forehead and facial sweating, miosis, ptosis and/or eyelid edema, usually last 15 minutes to 3 hours and can occur up to 8 times a day.

Now that we've arrived at a probable diagnosis, can you tell me what the typical treatment would be for cluster headaches?
STUDENT: The primary treatment for cluster headaches is generally separated into two types: abortive treatments and prophylactic treatments.

For abortive treatment, the goal is to alleviate the pain during an active headache. Options often include high-flow oxygen through a non-rebreather mask for about 15 minutes, or a triptan medication such as sumatriptan.

Prophylactic treatments are meant to prevent the headaches from occurring in the first place, and are generally recommended for patients with chronic or highly recurrent cluster headaches. This often includes medications like calcium channel blockers (verapamil is commonly used), corticosteroids, or lithium. 

Verapamil, a calcium channel blocker, is generally the first-choice prophylactic treatment for cluster headaches.
DOCTOR: That's an excellent summary of usual management for cluster headaches, highlighting both abortive and prophylactic strategies. However, there's another intervention that can be particularly useful in some cases. Despite MRI being normal, considering the frequency of our patient's headaches, we might need a treatment that tends to be more effective for cases like these. Does that give you an idea of another possible treatment more suited for her condition?
STUDENT: Yes, of course. Another technique that might be considered is nerve blocks, specifically a sphenopalatine ganglion block or greater occipital nerve block. It can provide significant reduction of cluster headache frequency and severity for weeks to months. 

Furthermore, considering the frequency of this patient's headaches, she may benefit from more invasive treatments such as deep brain stimulation or hypothalamic stimulation if medical therapies aren't effective. Also, non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation can help to some extent. 
DOCTOR: While those are indeed methods used to treat cluster headaches, they are typically used when first-line treatments are ineffective, intolerable, or contraindicated. In this patient's case, we have a unique treatment option. This drug is not typically first-line for most patients with cluster headache, but could be helpful in this patient due to the high frequency of her attacks. This is an anti-inflammatory drug, typically intended for use in arthritis or gout. Does this bring any potential treatment to mind?
STUDENT: Indeed, it does. You're probably referring to indomethacin. It's an anti-inflammatory drug most commonly used for conditions like arthritis or gout, but is also useful in some atypical headache syndromes. Indomethacin has been found to uniquely treat and prevent certain headache disorders characterized by their response to it. However, it's less typical as a first-line treatment for standard cluster headaches, though it's quite effective in particular cases. In this patient's case, due to her high-density attacks, it might be a worthy consideration.
DOCTOR: Exactly! Excellent reasoning, indomethacin is the correct answer. It's effective for a few specific headache syndromes, and, even though it's not as commonly used for typical cluster headaches, in her case, given the high frequency of her attacks, it could be really beneficial. Congratulations!

This concludes the case resolution, time to move on to the next one.</END>
STUDENT: Thank you, doctor. This case really highlighted the importance of considering each patient's unique symptoms and responses to guide treatment protocol. I look forward to reviewing the next case!
