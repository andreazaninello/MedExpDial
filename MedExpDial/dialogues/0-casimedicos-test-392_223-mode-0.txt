DOCTOR: Good morning student!
STUDENT: Good morning doctor, let's get started! Can you present the clinical case to me?
DOCTOR: Of course. We have a 68-year-old woman here with a history of two major depressive episodes. She again displayed depressive symptoms like sadness, depressed mood, anhedonia, asthenia, and anorexia, pointing to another depressive episode. She was prescribed 10 mg of escitalopram and after two weeks, her behaviour significantly changed. She reported she felt very well, with increased energy, hyperactivity, talkativeness and a desire to engage in activities. She expressed no feelings of irritability and reports that she is able to sleep for 6 continuous hours. Considering her recent history and behaviour, what condition would you consider that she might have?
STUDENT: The patient's sudden shift in mood and energy levels from depressive symptoms to feelings of well-being, elevated energy, and hyperactivity after starting on an antidepressant could suggest a diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder. Antidepressant medications, like escitalopram, can sometimes induce manic or hypomanic episodes in individuals with Bipolar Disorder. This can often lead to an initial misdiagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder if a practitioner is unaware of the patient's underlying bipolarity. Although this patient does not show irritability or decreased need for sleep which are common in manic episodes, the other symptoms of talkativeness, increased energy and a desire to engage in activities can still indicate a hypomanic episode.
DOCTOR: You've got the right conclusion. Indeed, this patient may be having a hypomanic episode induced by the initiation of escitalopram. It's important to carefully monitor patients with a history of depressive episodes for signs of hypomania or mania, particularly when they're initiated on antidepressant therapy. Your analysis reflects a good understanding of how to approach such complex situations. Well done! </END>
STUDENT: Thank you, doctor. I will certainly keep this case in mind as I prepare for my examination, especially the importance of monitoring patients on antidepressant therapy for signs of manic or hypomanic behavior. It really emphasizes the need for a comprehensive understanding of the side effects and potential impacts of medications on a patient's mental state.
