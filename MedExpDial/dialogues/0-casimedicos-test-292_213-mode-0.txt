DOCTOR: Good morning student!
STUDENT: Good morning doctor, let's get started! Can you present the clinical case to me?
DOCTOR: Absolutely! 

We have Gustavo who has presented to the ER with several symptoms, including general malaise, skin lesions, and joint inflammation. Notably, he has psoriasiform lesions on his trunk, palms, and soles. In conjunction with this, he also presents with bilateral ocular redness and erosions on the glans penis. He reported a risky sexual encounter occurred 20 days prior to the symptoms' onset. 

Given this collection of signs and symptoms, what diagnosis are you considering?
STUDENT: Given the described symptoms that include malaise, skin lesions, joint inflammation, lesions on trunk, palms and soles, ocular redness and erosions on the glans penis, I'm considering Reiter's syndrome, or reactive arthritis. This is a reactive arthropathy typically precipitated by sexually transmitted infection or foodborne illnesses, which aligns with the patient's recent risky sexual encounter. 

Could you confirm whether the patient reported any gastrointestinal symptoms or genitourinary symptoms prior to these symptoms' development? It would further support the diagnosis of reactive arthritis.
DOCTOR: You are right! The clinical case does not mention any gastrointestinal or genitourinary symptoms, but your inference is on the right track. Reactive arthritis (formerly known as Reiter's syndrome) is a classic triad of non-gonococcal urethritis, conjunctivitis, and arthritis, commonly following genitourinary or gastrointestinal infections. Conjunctival redness, joint inflammation, and erosions on the glans penis do indicate that this could be a case of reactive arthritis. His recent risky sexual activity points towards a genitourinary infection as the probable trigger event, connecting the presented symptoms. This particular case also includes skin manifestations, which mimics psoriasis and can occur in reactive arthritis, giving an even stronger link to the diagnosis. Therefore, Reactive arthritis is the most likely diagnosis. 
STUDENT: Thank you for the confirmation, doctor. In terms of treatment, for reactive arthritis, we usually provide symptomatic relief for joint symptoms using nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Additionally, physical therapy can also be useful. If the patient's arthritis symptoms are severe, reactive arthritis is sometimes treated with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) as well. Antibiotics might also be necessary if the triggering infection is still present, is that correct?
DOCTOR: Absolutely correct! Your understanding of the treatment protocol for reactive arthritis is spot on. This is a multifaceted approach, as we aim to treat the underlying trigger if still present, usually a Genitourinary or Gastrointestinal infection by using antibiotics. Concurrently we also aim to manage the resulting symptoms like joint pain and inflammation, for which NSAIDs, corticosteroids, or DMARDs could be used. Physical therapy does indeed play an important role in maintaining joint mobility and preventing stiffness. Great job!

STUDENT: Thank you for the feedback, doctor. I'm glad my understanding aligns with the standard care protocols. This has been a highly beneficial learning discussion for me. Ready for the next case when you are!
