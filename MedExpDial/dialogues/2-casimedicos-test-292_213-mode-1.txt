DOCTOR: Good morning student!
STUDENT: Good morning doctor, let's get started! Can you present the clinical case to me?
DOCTOR: Certainly, today we have a case about a patient named Gustavo. He came to the emergency room with skin lesions and general malaise which had persisted for several days. On physical examination, skin lesions were seen that resembled psoriasis on his trunk, including the palms and soles of his feet. He also had signs of asymmetrical non-suppurative joint inflammation, bilateral ocular redness, and erosions on his glans penis. During his medical history taking, Gustavo disclosed that he had a risky sexual encounter about 20 days prior to his admission. Can you make a diagnosis based on these findings?
STUDENT: The patient's presentation of psoriasiform skin lesions, non-suppurative joint inflammation, ocular redness, and erosions on his glans penis, combined with the history of a sexual encounter makes me suspicious of Reactive Arthritis, previously known as Reiter's syndrome. This is caused by certain bacterial infections and commonly presents as a triad of conjunctivitis, urethritis, and arthritis. 

The skin manifestations and erosions in the penis may correspond to balanitis circinata, a feature that could be seen in this context.

However, in the context of risky sexual behavior, concurrent sexually transmitted infections might be present and should be ruled out, like syphilis or HIV for example.

In order to confirm the diagnosis, I would need to conduct further testing including tests for Chlamydia trachomatis and HIV, among others. The joint inflammation would also require further evaluation, potentially including joint aspiration and analysis of fluid. If arthritis is confirmed, this would strengthen the likelihood of Reactive Arthritis. 

If Chlamydia trachomatis is detected, that would definitely confirm Reactive Arthritis as Chlamydia is one of the known triggers of this condition. If not, I would consider other sexually transmitted infections and potentially other types of arthritis as well. 

Can you provide blood test results or more information on the patient's symptoms if available?
DOCTOR: You've done an excellent analysis and reasoning! Indeed, your suspicion is correct. This patient is suffering from Reiter's syndrome. It is indeed also referred to as reactive arthritis, as you mentioned. This syndrome often occurs as a reaction to infections, predominantly genitourinary or gastrointestinal ones. In many cases, as you've pointed out, the triggering infection is with Chlamydia trachomatis.

This condition's diagnostic is clinical, based on the typical triad of arthritis, conjunctivitis or uveitis, and urethritis. The skin manifestations and penile erosions that he presents are called keratoderma blennorrhagica and circinate balanitis, respectively, which are characteristic of this disease.

Given the recent risky sexual encounter disclosed by Gustavo, the triggering infection is likely sexually transmitted, though the necessary testing should indeed be conducted to confirm this and to rule out other sexually transmitted infections, as well as to monitor and manage Gustavo's condition effectively.

Good job, today you have learned to recognize Reiter's syndrome!

STUDENT: Thank you, doctor! It was an intriguing case. I appreciate your guidance and input. This indeed has provided me with more insight into dealing with sexually transmitted diseases and the importance of a broad differential. I'll apply this knowledge to future cases and continue to learn from them.
