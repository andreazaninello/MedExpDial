DOCTOR: Good morning student!
STUDENT: Good morning doctor, let's get started! Can you present the clinical case to me?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. This case involves a 71-year-old woman who has a history of rheumatoid arthritis. She's currently on three different medications: sulfasalazine, prednisone and etanercept. The woman presented to the emergency room after experiencing symptoms consistent with facial herpes zoster for approximately 72 hours. The facial herpes zoster influences the right side of her face and the auricular pavilion, but it spares her forehead and causes a swelling of the conjunctiva called conjunctival chemosis. So, considering her symptoms and her medical condition, can you suggest the most appropriate treatment?
STUDENT: The usual treatment for herpes zoster involves the use of antivirals. However, since the patient has a pre-existing condition of rheumatoid arthritis and is on immunosuppressive therapy including etanercept, her immune response might be compromised. Also she has already been experiencing symptoms for 72 hours. The usual first line antiviral for herpes zoster, Acyclovir, is most efficient when given within 72 hours. 

Since the infection involves her face and eye area (indicated by the conjunctival chemosis), there may be a risk of herpes zoster ophthalmicus, which could lead to severe complications such as vision loss. Hence, she might require more aggressive therapy. 

Considering these factors, the most appropriate treatment might be intravenous (IV) antivirals. I think IV acyclovir could be a good option, and she should also be evaluated by an ophthalmologist urgently to assess the eye involvement and prevent complications. 

Could you confirm if my suggestion is correct, doctor?  

DOCTOR: Yes, you're absolutely right. The patient's compromised immune system and late presentation mean that her treatment should be more aggressive than normal. Intravenous acyclovir would indeed be the most appropriate initial treatment. This treatment is generally continued until clinical improvement is observed. In addition to this, consultation with an ophthalmologist is essential due to the risk of ophthalmic complications. So, the management of this woman's condition would indeed involve multidisciplinary care, addressing both her immediate symptoms and potential complications. Excellent reasoning. </END>
STUDENT: Thank you for confirming, doctor. I'm glad to know that my reasoning was correct. It's really important to consider the entire clinical picture including the patient's underlying conditions and the timing of the presentation to decide the appropriate course of treatment. I will definitely keep this case in mind as I prepare for my USMLE examination.
