DOCTOR: Good morning student!
STUDENT: Good morning doctor, let's get started! Can you present the clinical case to me?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Our patient is a 70-year-old woman who has a history of anorexia, weight loss, muscle discomfort, pain in her proximal joints and in the temporomandibular region. She recently reported to the emergency department, concerned about a sudden unilateral loss of vision which was painless. It was determined to be an afferent pupillary defect. 
Now, based on this information, can you tell me what test you would want to request first for diagnostic purposes?
STUDENT: This patient's symptoms of anorexia, weight loss, muscle discomfort, and joint pain, along with the sudden unilateral vision loss, are concerning for Giant Cell Arteritis, a vasculitis that can affect the temporal arteries and other vessels. The afferent pupillary defect indicates disease along the optic nerve pathway.

Given this, the first diagnostic test I would request is an Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR), also known as a Sed rate. It may be elevated in conditions with systemic inflammation such as Giant Cell Arteritis. If this test comes back elevated, the next step would likely be a temporal artery biopsy to confirm the diagnosis. Starting high dose corticosteroids should be considered even before the biopsy, as this condition may lead to irreversible blindness.
DOCTOR: That's correct! You're considering the temporal arteritis or Giant Cell Arteritis as a possibility with these clinical findings is prudent. And as you correctly outlined, the first line test to request is the Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR). This test is sensitive but not specific for inflammation, and a heightened value might indicate arteritis among other conditions. If the ESR is elevated, further diagnostic procedures such as temporal artery biopsy are warranted. Your remark about starting with high-dose corticosteroids even before the biopsy results is also key, this approach is taken due to the risk of permanent blindness which this condition poses. Well done! </END>
STUDENT: Thank you, doctor! Looking forward to learning more in our next session.
