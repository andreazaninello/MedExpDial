DOCTOR: Good morning student!
STUDENT: Good morning doctor, let's get started! Can you present the clinical case to me?
DOCTOR: Of course. Let's dive right in. Our patient is a 70-year-old woman. She has a history of anorexia, weight loss, discomfort in her musculature, proximal joint pain, and pain in the temporomandibular region. She is now in the emergency department for sudden, painless unilateral loss of vision, a condition defined as hand movement, and has shown an afferent pupillary defect. Based on this clinical scenario, what test would you request first for diagnostic purposes?
STUDENT: Based on the patient's symptoms, this could be a case of Giant Cell Arteritis (Temporal Arteritis). The sudden loss of vision along with the afferent pupillary defect is highly concerning and requires immediate attention. While the definitive diagnosis would involve a temporal artery biopsy, given the acute nature of visual loss, immediate treatment is crucial to prevent irreversible blindness.

As a result, the first step would be to start high-dose corticosteroids to control the inflammation and prevent any further damage. The diagnostic test that I would request first would be primarily the Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) and C-Reactive Protein (CRP) levels, which are usually elevated in Giant Cell Arteritis. However, these tests cannot confirm the diagnosis but can provide significant evidence to support it. To reach a conclusive diagnosis, a temporal artery biopsy might be needed eventually, if the clinical scenario allows and depending on the patient's response to treatment. Could you confirm if I am on the right path?
DOCTOR: Yes, you are on the right path. In cases like this where the patient is experiencing a sudden, painless loss of vision, time is of the essence. While a temporal artery biopsy is indeed the gold standard for diagnosis of Giant Cell Arteritis, it would take too long and risk the patient losing vision entirely in the affected eye. Thus, the first diagnostic step in an emergency setting should be laboratory investigations to check for general signs of inflammation, such as an elevated Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) or C-Reactive Protein (CRP) level. Indeed, the correct answer is C-Reactive Protein. Keep in mind, as you correctly noted, that while these tests are supportive, they cannot confirm the diagnosis alone. You did a great job analysing this case and proposing the appropriate management. </END>
STUDENT: Thank you for your clear explanation and feedback, doctor. I understand the importance of time in such acute settings now and the need to balance between the urgency of treatment and the pursuit of definitive diagnosis. I will keep that in mind for future cases. I look forward to our next session.
