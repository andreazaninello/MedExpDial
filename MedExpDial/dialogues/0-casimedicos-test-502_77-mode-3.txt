DOCTOR: Good morning student!
STUDENT: Good morning doctor, let's get started! Can you present the clinical case to me?
DOCTOR: Absolutely! We have a 6-month-old infant who has been brought to the emergency department due to respiratory distress. Upon examination, the following results were observed: an axillary temperature of 37.2Â°C, a respiratory rate of 40 rpm, heart rate is 160 bpm, blood pressure 90/45 mmHg, and a SatO2 level of 95% on room air. The baby is showing moderate respiratory distress, with evidence of intercostal and subcostal retraction. Pulmonary auscultation reports scattered expiratory rhonchi, elongated expiration, and a slight decrease in air entry in both lung fields. Cardiac auscultation demonstrated no murmurs. The decision was made to keep the patient under observation in the hospital for a few hours. 

Considering these observations, what do you think is the most appropriate next step with regards to the complementary tests?
STUDENT: Given the symptoms and physical examination of the patient, it seems like a typical case of bronchiolitis, commonly seen in infants. It's usually a viral infection and presents with symptoms of respiratory distress, high respiratory rate, and changes in lung auscultation, very similar to your case.

Regarding the complementary tests, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends against routine tests - which include complete blood count, chest radiography, or respiratory viral panel - in most cases of bronchiolitis. These tests rarely make a difference in the management of the disease and can add unnecessary costs and burden on healthcare resources.

So, in this case, I believe that instead of running any tests right away, the baby should be closely monitored, and supportive care should be provided. Tests should be considered if the condition gets severe, doesn't improve with time, or if there is a suspicion of any other condition. 

Do you agree with this approach, doctor?
DOCTOR: You're absolutely right! Excellent recall of the American Academy of Pediatrics recommendations. Bronchiolitis is typically a clinical diagnosis in infants presenting with a history of upper respiratory tract infection followed by the onset of wheezing, cough, and difficulty feeding. Given that it is most often viral, routine laboratory tests are not indicated in typical cases.

In this case, keeping the patient under observation in the hospital for a few hours and providing supportive care is the best approach as you determined. Tests should be considered only if there's deterioration, or suspicion of any other condition. 

Congratulations for the correct application of knowledge, and the complete and concise management of the patient!

Remember, focusing resources on symptomatic management, such as ensuring hydration and oxygen saturation and providing the necessary support for feeding, are much more crucial. This also helps alleviate the patient's discomfort and allows you to monitor for any potential worsening of the patient's condition.

So, the correct answer is indeed - 4. Do not request complementary tests.

Well done, future doctor, keep it up!</END>
STUDENT: Thank you for the elaboration and confirmation, doctor! It's indeed crucial to remember that not all presentations require intensive testing, especially for conditions like bronchiolitis which is generally self-limiting and managed symptomatically. I appreciate your guidance and warm encouragement. Ready for the next case!
