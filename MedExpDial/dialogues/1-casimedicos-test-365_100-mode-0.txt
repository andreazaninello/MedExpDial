DOCTOR: Good morning student!
STUDENT: Good morning doctor, let's get started! Can you present the clinical case to me?
DOCTOR: Of course! We have a 64-year-old farmer in front of us today. He's a former smoker who quit 5 years ago, and he has both chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) as well as rheumatoid arthritis, for which he is on corticosteroid therapy. For the last 2 days, he's been suffering from an intense headache and noticed deviation of his oral commissure, which led him to come to the emergency department. He also informed us that, for the past month following the flu, he's had a persistent cough, purulent and sometimes bloody sputum, fever, loss of appetite, fatigue, and weight loss. Upon examination, he had a fever of 38.2ÂºC. We found multiple skin abscesses on his hands, back, and buttocks, some of which had fistulous tracts. There was right central facial paralysis. Imaging showed apical infiltrates with a small associated pleural effusion, and his white cell counts were elevated with neutrophilia. Among the various potential diagnoses, what do you think the most likely one might be?
STUDENT: Although this patient has many relevant factors in his history, the onset of facial paralysis and neural symptoms following the flu as well as his occupation as a farmer are especially notable. Additionally, the skin abscesses with fistulous tracts and his pulmonary symptoms are also significant. These features make me suspect that he may have Nocardia infection which can also explain disseminated diseases like COPD and chronic steroid use. This infection can cause pulmonary, cutaneous and even neurological involvement. The purulent and bloody sputum and weight loss may reflect a pneumonia due to Nocardia, and the headaches and facial paralysis may be due to central nervous system involvement. The skin abscesses could also be due to this infection. These manifestations, unfortunately, indicates a disseminated form of Nocardiosis. Can we use further tests to verify this?
DOCTOR: Indeed, you're correct. Your logic and diagnostic reasoning are good. The patient's lifestyle, occupation and medical history of COPD and rheumatoid arthritis can predispose him to opportunistic infections such as Nocardia. The Nocardia species are Gram-positive, partially acid-fast, filamentous bacteria that can cause localized or disseminated infections, commonly involving lungs, central nervous system (CNS), and skin.

So, to confirm this suspicion, we should collect samples for microbiologic testing. This could include sputum, blood, and pus from the abscesses for culture, acid-fast staining, and PCR. In terms of imaging, a chest CT could provide additional details about the extent of the lung disease and a brain MRI could potentially reveal brain abscesses, which are common in CNS nocardiosis. 

Remember to always consider the patient's occupation and lifestyle when making differential diagnoses. In this case, it pointed us towards a rather rare, but plausible, diagnosis due to his farming and gardening activities, where he might have come in contact with soil teeming with Nocardia. 

Let's do those additional tests and see if they fit our hypothesis. Good job! </END>
STUDENT: Thank you, doctor! I appreciate the advice and I'll certainly keep this case in mind. I understand that each piece of information can be utterly vital in determining the correct diagnosis, especially in more complex and rare cases like this one. The intricate correlations between his lifestyle, underlying diseases, his medication use, and the unique bouquet of symptoms he presents truly underline the importance of a thorough and comprehensive approach to medical diagnostics. Looking forward to our next case! </END>
