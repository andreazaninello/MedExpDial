DOCTOR: Good morning student!
STUDENT: Good morning doctor, let's get started! Can you present the clinical case to me?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, let's go through it. We have a 56-year-old woman with a history of well-controlled schizophrenia and no toxic habits. She was admitted for middle lobe pneumonia with a small associated metapneumonic pleural effusion and is currently on treatment with levofloxacin 500 mg/24h. Despite a generally positive clinical evolution, she's been experiencing persistent febrile fever and leukocytosis on the sixth day of treatment. Unfortunately, microbiological studies are not available.

Here's a question: What would you consider to be the most appropriate course of action in this case?
STUDENT: In this case, the patient's persistent febrile fever and leukocytosis despite treatment suggest the current antibiotics may not be effective, or there may be an evolving complication of her pneumonia. Given her metapneumonic pleural effusion, it's possible this could have progressed to a more severe condition such as a complicated pleural effusion or an empyema.

In the absence of microbiological studies, I would consider performing a diagnostic thoracocentesis. This would allow us to evaluate and classify the nature of the pleural effusion, as well as guide us in the most appropriate antibiotic coverage. If a complicated pleural effusion or empyema is present, the patient may also require drainage in addition to change or update in her antibiotic regimen. Is this the correct approach, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely! Your reasoning is spot on. The persistence of her symptoms and leukocytosis alongside a history of metapneumonic effusion makes it imperative to rule out the presence of an empyema. This can be done through a thoracentesis – which will not only confirm the diagnosis but also guide the next steps in terms of treatment.

Therefore, the option 3: Performing thoracentesis to rule out empyema, is indeed the best course of action in this case. Very well done! 

Keep in mind, however, each patient's case is unique and lab results, including microbiological studies, will further provide specific clues to guide therapy. Nevertheless, in this case, and with the information on hand, this would be the ideal approach. Well done!

STUDENT: Thank you, Doctor, for the feedback and insight. The suggestion to perform a thoracentesis, which could confirm the presence of an empyema or complicated pleural effusion, seems like the most reasonable approach given the patient’s persistent symptoms. I understand the importance of individualizing patient care and considering all available lab results, in cases where they are available. Thanks again for your guidance, and I look forward to furthering my knowledge with more clinical cases.
